Giveth Hackathon - Exploring Recursive Task-based Organizations

# Main Idea:
Smart contracts not only enable us to prototype organizational structure, but also prototype algorithms that can generate organizational structures. Since a smart contract can handle both recruitment and receive funds, it is possible to generate financially sustainable smart contracts.

This means, for the first time, we have the technology to prototype technology-based organisms, whose movement is algorithmically recruited human labor and lifeblood is (cryptocurrency) capital. In particular, a cryptocurrency-based organizm lives on the same borderless wavelength as the online labor it recruits, a critical piece of overhead that slows traditional crowdsourcing workflows. Whether you're looking to make your company into a DAO, or build a novel organizational structure such as a dynamic self regulating charity, this is an extremely exciting development. However, there are some critical problems to figure out along the way.

# Problem
Complex crowdsourcing is hard. Ideally, we could break down any complex revenue generating task that our organism wishes to embark on into small micro-tasks. Ironically, generating workflows of tasks is a task in and of itself. In fact, the academic collective intelligence community has realized that for anything interesting, No Workflow Can Ever Be Enough [1] - there must be a new paradigm developed. This presents a problem for our blockchain-based organism, one that weâ€™ll need to solve if we want it to solve non trivial complex tasks by itself to be self-sustaining.

# The way forward
## Initial Stage:
Brainstorm several solutions to implementing task subcontracting on the blockchain. The current leading thought is a combination of a recursive token that vests as each subcontract is verified as complete and ready to be merged. However, other solutions may present themselves. We'll need to think about both task decomposition and integration.

## Prototype Stage:
We implement our idea in pure solidity, and test the basic concepts. This stage culminates in a pure solidity proof of concept.

## Integration Stage:
Taking our solidity code, and integrating it into a current DAO platform such as Aragon. This stage culminates in a small proof of concept.

## Experiment Stage:
Deploy our solution with mini-user study and analyze the performance and faults of our solution. This stage culminates in a blogpost.
